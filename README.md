Welcome to the College Student Leave Management System! This system simplifies leave applications for college students.
The online form captures essential details: name, student ID, course info, leave dates, reason, and optional documentation.
Integrated with the college's student management system for tracking and approval.
Features automated email notifications for submission confirmation and approval status updates.

Technologies:
1]HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages.
In this project, HTML is likely used to create the layout and structure of the leave submission form, including input fields, labels, and buttons.

2]CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is used for styling the HTML elements, controlling the presentation, layout, and design of web pages.
It ensures a visually appealing and consistent user interface for the leave submission form.
CSS can define colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of the form.

3]React:
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
It enables the creation of reusable UI components, which can simplify the development process and improve code organization.
React's component-based architecture is likely used to create dynamic and interactive elements within the leave submission form, such as date pickers, dropdown menus, and form validation.

4]Node.js:
Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on the server side.
In this project, Node.js is likely used to build the backend server that handles requests from the client-side application.
It may handle tasks such as routing, validation, and database interactions (if applicable).

5]Email.js (or similar library/module):
Email.js is a JavaScript library for sending emails directly from client-side applications.
It simplifies the process of integrating email functionality into web applications without needing a backend server.
In this project, Email.js could be used to send automated email notifications to users upon form submission and approval status updates.
It provides an easy-to-use API for sending emails, allowing developers to focus on the application logic without worrying about email server configuration.
